# Strava-DiscordBot
A discord-based bot implementation of the Strava API for showcasing club leaderboards and user activities.

There are some functions that are currently not implemented, though their structure exists
Much of this code is not commented as it was mainly just for my use, and initially was just a project for me
to learn how to implement Strava into a Discord Bot. Sorry about that.

If you still intend to use it, good luck, read what comments I do have, and enjoy!
