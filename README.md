# Strava-DiscordBot
A discord-based bot implementation of the Strava API for showcasing club leaderboards and user activities.

The code is not written for scale in mind, and has yet to implement some key features.
I have yet to implement limit checks for requests to the strava API, staggered requests for updating access tokens, and webhooks to update user activities
The authorization command is not yet completed (not very user friendly)
there are still a few bugs and everything has yet to be comprehensively tested.

If you still intend to use it, good luck, read what comments I do have, and enjoy!
